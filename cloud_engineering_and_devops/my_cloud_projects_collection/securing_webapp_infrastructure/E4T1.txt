# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- 1. Disable SSH Password login
- 2. Restrict traffic to application server
Updating security group assigned to the web application to allow connection only from load balancer subnet (and specific admin bastion host IP if needed).

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- 1. We can update IAM policy  for the instance role c3-app-InstanceRole in the cloud formation template to only allow read access to the free recipes S3 bucket, not to others.
- 2. Another good practise would be to encrypt data with encryption key, so attacker without the key cannot decrypt them.
