# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- No, if the IAM permission for the S3 bucket are still insecure, creating VPC private endpoints would not prevent unauthorized access to the secret recipes S3bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- No, enabling encryption on S3 will affect only new data.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- The remediation steps we did would be reverted and original security risks would be back. To prevent it, CloudFormation code must be updated with fixes we did.
