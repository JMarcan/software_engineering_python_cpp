Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security

# Poor practise 1:
The IAM role policy attached to EC2 instancs allow full access to all S3 buckets.
That can attacker here exploit to get via instances access to bucket with secret recipe vault.
Violation of the least privilege principle. 

# Poor practise 2:
S3 bucket has not enabled server-side encryption.
If attacker gets to them, he can easily read all data stored there.

# Poor practise 3:
WebAppSG has 5000 and 80 ports opened.
This means unecrypted HTTP communication for end users.
Tt should be configured with 443 HTTPS port encrypting the communication.

# Poor practise 4:
No restrictive ACL rules are configured.
For example EC2 instances route tables has DesinationCidrBlock defined as 0.0.0.0/0
This means that attacker can connect to any machine within VPC or outside of VPC.

# Poor practise 5:
EC2 instance for web server is placed behind load balancer, but still located in public subnet accesible to attackers.
This instance is retrieving data from S3.
Safer option would be to move this EC2 instance to the private subnet so attacker has no direct access to it.
