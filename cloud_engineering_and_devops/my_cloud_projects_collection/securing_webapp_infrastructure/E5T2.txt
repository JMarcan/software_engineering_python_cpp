# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- Tool: TFSec, TFLint

### Example vulnerability detected by TFSec
- Ingress open to 0.0.0.0/0
- Unecrypted S3 bucket

In addition TFLint checks for things as:
- Invalid instance type
- Not existing AMI provided
- Not existing security group referenced

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Tool: Clair

### Example vulnerability
- Publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)
- For example: CVE-2018-6954 | https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6954 | Description: systemd-tmpfiles in systemd through 237 mishandles symlinks present in non-terminal path components, which allows local users to obtain ownership of arbitrary files via vectors involving creation of a directory and a file under that directory, and later replacing that directory with a symlink. This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- Tool: AWS Security Hub 
AWS Security Hub centralize findings from AWS security tools (AWS config, AWS Inspector for network,  ...)

### Example vulnerability
- Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
- Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse
