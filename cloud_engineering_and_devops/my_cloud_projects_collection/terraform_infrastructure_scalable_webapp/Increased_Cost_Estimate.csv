,,,,,,,,"Rationale

For higher budget rising from 9000 USD to 20 000 USD
- Max number of EC2 instances was increased to 24 
   Offering scalable 2x redundancy for peak loads to be able to handle even more users
- EC2 instances were increased to t3.2xlarge (Memory: 32GiB, vCPU: 8)
  - To decrease processing request time for each user and offer slighly better user experience
- As DB server is used serverless Aurora DB 
    With automated scaling to offer fast response at any loads"
