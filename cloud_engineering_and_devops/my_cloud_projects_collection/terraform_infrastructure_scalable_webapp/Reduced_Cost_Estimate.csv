Acknowledgement,,,,,,,,"Rationale

To adress budget restrictions changing from 9 000 USD to 6 500 USD / monthly
With resulting total cost of 6 214 USD / month:

I) 12 EC2 Instances were downdgraded to t3.xlarge (Memory: 8GiB, vCPU: 2) costing 759,58 USD / month 
    from t3.2xlarge (Memory: 32GiB, vCPU: 8) costing 1863,34 USD / month | 
    By keeping the same amount of available servers, application can still serve to its 50k users when demand is high.
    However the latency can be slightly slower than with initial configuration.

II) EC2 price was further reduced by reserving 3-year computing capacity
As the company intention is operate applicaiton long term, 
3 years commitment to computing capacity allows company get better pricing 
and still keep flexibility to upgrade machines any time.
  
III)DB server was reduced to  db.m5.8xlarge (Memory: 128GiB, vCPU: 32) costing 2,670 USD / month 
    from  db.m5.8xlarge (Memory: 192GiB, vCPU: 48) costing 4,002 USD / month
    Application can still serve to its 50k users when demand is high,
    However the latency can be slightly slower than with initial configuration.
